In Combined Heat and Power, the waste heat produced in a plant facility is utilized in other industrial processes, extracted to cover the heat demand of individual buildings, or exported to a district heating system. CHP plants are typically based on gas and/or steam turbines in simple or combined cycle configuration. In simple cycle, the waste heat generated by a gas turbine is captured in a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) or waste heat recovery boiler (WHRB) and used for heating or to produce process steam. In combined cycle CHP it is initially used to fuel a second turbine producing additional power.
