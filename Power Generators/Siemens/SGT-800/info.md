SGT-800

The Siemens SGT-800 industrial gas turbine combines a reliable robust design with high efficiency and low emis-sions. The turbine offers broad flexibility in fuels, opera-tion conditions, maintenance concepts, package solutions and ratings to meet current and future market needs. 
The SGT-800 affords very competitive economy for a variety of industrial power generation customers such as energy companies, independent power producers, utilities and municipalities. Excellent capabilities for different needs The excellent efficiency and steam-raising capability of the SGT-800 makes it outstanding in cogeneration and combined cycle installations, including process industries and district heating schemes. 
The robust design and proven high reliability also makes the SGT-800 an excel-lent choice for refineries and for other oil and gas customers.The SGT-800 is available in two versions with ISO ratings from 47.5 MW(e) to 50.5 MW(e) and with a flexibility in between. For excellent performance at high ambient temperatures (>33Â°C) a hot match compressor option is available with increased power output and efficiency.
