The SGT-A45 TR gas turbine is integrated into a mobile unit that can be installed and commissioned in less than two weeks and can begin generating electricity immediately. With an electrical output of up to 44 megawatts, the aeroderivative gas turbine delivers more power and higher efficiency than any other mobile gas turbine.

Modular design for rapid deployment
“This innovative Siemens gas turbine will provide flexible and rapid supply of electricity, enabling it to quickly support critical power needs,” says Nick Muntz, CEO of Siemens’ Distributed Generation business unit.

The design leverages the know-how and experience gained from millions of operating hours accumulated in flight, industrial and marine service. It is based on Rolls-Royce Aero-Engine technology, and the gas turbine core utilizes components from the Siemens Industrial Trent 60.

The standardization and modular design of the package enable rapid deployment and installation. Each unit is fully assembled and tested at the factory in order to verify operation and performance and minimize the scope of commissioning work needed on site.
Reliable and fuel-flexible
In addition to being reliable, the SGT-A45 TR is flexible. Its relatively low weight facilitates transport by air, land, or sea. It can run on gas or liquid fuels – and transition smoothly between both fuel types while in operation. Low NOx emissions can be achieved with optional water injection, which also boosts the unit’s power output, particularly in warm climates.

The aeroderivative gas turbine can generate full power in less than 9 minutes from start without the need for auxiliary systems to maintain the unit in an operationally ready standby mode. In the event of a shutdown, the unit can be restarted at any time to restore power quickly, as it has no “hot lockout” restrictions.
