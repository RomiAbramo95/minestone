SINGAPORE
Why is Singapore the best location for an ICO? Several key features make Singapore an attractive place for businesses engaged in blockchain activities. The Monetary Authority of Singapore issued clarifying information on token sales as well as ICO guidance, stating when ICOs are to be treated as securities and when not. It all depends on circumstances and economic transaction situations. In general, Singapore is neutral on cryptocurrency activities, though it does warn of possible risks. Its favorable attitude encourages blockchain businesses to launch their ICOs and develop innovative projects. Furthermore, the structure, as supported by the government, has proven to be reliable, which opens great opportunities to entrepreneurs.

The Enjin Coin (ENJ) is a bright example of an effective ICO launched in Singapore. It is a gaming platform that offers customized currencies and goods.
