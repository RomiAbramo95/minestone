WHICH COUNTRIES ARE ICO-FRIENDLY? 

In order to stress the best countries for blockchain startups, it is necessary to analyze their ICO history. The best country is considered to have the highest number of successful ICO launches. Therefore, let’s consider successful ICOs to be those that:

have a stable position in the market
are not involved in legal issues
are still active
have not been recognized in fraudulent schemes
have raised over $10 million.
Here is the list of countries where ICOs raised over $10 million.

SINGAPORE
Why is Singapore the best location for an ICO? Several key features make Singapore an attractive place for businesses engaged in blockchain activities. The Monetary Authority of Singapore issued clarifying information on token sales as well as ICO guidance, stating when ICOs are to be treated as securities and when not. It all depends on circumstances and economic transaction situations. In general, Singapore is neutral on cryptocurrency activities, though it does warn of possible risks. Its favorable attitude encourages blockchain businesses to launch their ICOs and develop innovative projects. Furthermore, the structure, as supported by the government, has proven to be reliable, which opens great opportunities to entrepreneurs.

The Enjin Coin (ENJ) is a bright example of an effective ICO launched in Singapore. It is a gaming platform that offers customized currencies and goods.
Because the coin fails the Howey Test, it is not classified as a security. In addition, transactions within this platform remain trustless, and are verified on Ethereum. In any other country with heavier regulations, this ICO could be questioned. However, in Singapore, it has raised more than $20 million, and has become the biggest gaming community.

SWITZERLAND
Without a doubt, one of the main hubs for an ICO launch is Switzerland. If you want to choose a country for launching an ICO, consider it an option! Due to its blockchain-friendly policy and the Crypto Valley ecosystem, it attracts many prosperous ICO campaigns. The four largest ICOs of 2017, Tezos, Bancor, Status, and the DAO, were hosted in this country. The local government is eager to support technological innovations and develop a blockchain sector.

CAYMAN ISLANDS
The British territory of the Cayman Islands is an interesting choice for any company launching an ICO. Its political and legal platform offers a regulatory framework based upon international standards, thus with fewer regulations. However, if you are interested in carrying out blockchain transactions in the Cayman Islands, you must understand the process of token-building. As mentioned above, if it is considered a security, it has to undergo a set of SEC regulations. According to the Cayman Islands definition, “security” is not applied to an ICO token, which is an advantageous feature that promotes the token sale procedure. Another benefit is that the local regulatory authorities have properly set the blockchain supervisory structure, and do not delay implementation, which attracts many entrepreneurs.

Block one is a prosperous ICO launched in the Cayman Islands that raised over $185 million in just a few days! It designs free market systems to secure life, liberty, and property. It has proven to be the most powerful infrastructure for applications independent of central authorities.

THE ISLE OF MAN
Though the Isle of Man is a self-governing country, it is a British crown dependency. Consequently, their policy toward token sales is compliant with anti-money-laundering strategy and know your customer (KYC) policy, as in the U.K. However, the dependency considers ICOs to be of high potential, and believes they represent a massive vertical market. Therefore, the authorities have developed permissive legislation to increase blockchain activity on the island, and would be eager to support all businesses through the token sale procedure.

GIBRALTAR (U.K.)
The government of Gibraltar recently issued a white paper that classifies tokens as commercial products, not securities. Therefore, ICOs can be launched there easily. The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission also provides a regulatory framework in which each ICO issuer needs to have a supervisor who ensures that the campaign complies with all regulations. This is not a disadvantage; the regime supports issuers and helps to organize a secure, risk-free campaign. In addition, the market, not the regulators, outlines “good” token sales for investors.

Gibraltar hosts four ICOs that have raised more than $10 million. Among them are WePower ($40 million), Energi Token ($15 million), Rentberry ($30 million), and Globitex ($15.5 million).

MAURITIUS
This island country in the Indian Ocean is an international financial paradise! It boasts one of the highest incomes, and attracts many businesses eager to launch their ICOs. Due to its political and economic stability, Mauritius offers a reliable and secure banking system. A blockchain startup can be launched here in just a few days! It must be stated that the security laws are favorable; therefore, a token can be built without falling under that precise definition. The regulatory sandbox is favorable, as well, and is especially beneficial for startups that want to be regulated. As for taxation, there is a registration fee as well as an annual fee of $350. On the other hand, Mauritius isn’t as privileged as Switzerland or Singapore, as it has a reputation as a shady tax island.

MALTA
Another beautiful place for blockchain startups! The country positions itself as ICO-friendly. Businesses can especially benefit from the taxation policy of 5% for foreign entrepreneurs, with 0% on certain token models. Malta offers an ICO-hosting platform covering all steps of an ICO launch, from token formation and ICO development plan to investment security in the multi-signature wallet. The launch process can take some time and effort, but the advantages are obvious, as all ICOs here are legally protected.

BALTIC NATIONS
Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have committed to support blockchain development technologies in their countries as of November 2017. According to a Memorandum of Understanding, local governments desire to cooperate in order to develop regional capital markets.

All the Baltic countries support ICOs, for the most part. Factors like a favorable technological environment, the possibility of managing campaigns from abroad, and supportive local authorities make them ICO-friendly. Certain legal issues still exist, and should be considered when launching an ICO.

RUSSIA
Russia also allows blockchain activities within the country. For now, there are no precise restrictions, but they are subject to future regulations. According to orders issued by the Kremlin, token registration and taxation are in place, in addition to security compliance. A plan for token use in a single payment system is specified, too.

Russia hosts a high number of successful ICOs! Here is a short list of those that raised more than $10 million in the token sale.
Having discussed the best countries to launch your ICO, it’s important to point out that all of them are different in regulatory attitudes toward blockchain technologies. Each one offers different ways of structuring frameworks. However, as we discussed, some regulations are really heavy, while others open new opportunities for ICO launches. To sum up, let’s outline the main features of the best countries for blockchain startups:

ICO tokens should not be treated as securities in order to eliminate SEC regulations.
The government of the host country should be supportive, and encourage blockchain development technologies.
Taking into account the features we’ve mentioned, as well as the sandbox regulatory policy, taxation and bank operations benefits, and, of course, the biggest number of completed ICOs (over $10 million raised), let’s outline the best ICO-friendly countries:
